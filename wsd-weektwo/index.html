<h2> Jigsaw Facts </h2>
             <h4>What number does Xavier find on the back of Gus' neck? <br><br>
             2. This is what Jigsaw meant by saying that the clues are in the back of their minds. The numbers are colour-coded, so they know that the clue is 'somewhere over the rainbow'. When Xavier discovers this, he tries to kill Jonas. Jonas starts to win the fight, but he starts coughing up blood, and Xavier gets the chance to kill him with the nail bat. Meanwhile, Laura finds a picture with an X on it and they look behind it to find a picture of Matthews and Daniel. They all realize that Matthews and Daniel are father and son and that Matthews put them in jail by planting evidence. Laura starts convulsing on the floor and she dies while Addison goes off on her own. </h4> <br><br> <div class="content">
